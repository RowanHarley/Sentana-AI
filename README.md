# Sentana-AI 
We've seen many private Artificial Intelligences fail, like Siri for example. My aim is to make one which anyone can contribute to.

## How it will work
My plans for this project is to make the artificial intelligence learn just as a human would, but at a much faster pace. For example: By looking at an image of a fruit, it may look for similar images online, get the name of the fruit and upload all this information to a cloud database. This would let future versions of the AI more intelligent. Other ideas to teach the AI are:

- Manual teaching (AKA - Put ideas straight onto the database... inefficient)
- Learning through beta versions (AKA - People using the beta versions would be able to fill in information about images, sentence structures, etc... Possibly more efficient than original idea
